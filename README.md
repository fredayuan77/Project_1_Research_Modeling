 ## Description
### Research Question
 This study aims to examine how individuals’ long-term happiness is related to: (1) objective family income level; and (2) subjective social classes. I have also compared the happiness effects among income, class, and other socioeconomic factors (educational degree and age).

### Hypothesis
1. Individuals living in higher-income families are generally happier than those in lower-income families.
2. Individuals who perceive themselves to be in higher social classes are generally happier than those who self-identified as lower classes.

### Dataset
This study uses General Social Survey (GSS) in 2018, comprising 1419 respondents in the sample. The survey measures people’s general happiness in the relatively long term and records their demographics information. Data source: [GSS 2018 Dataset](https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data)

## Conclusion
Both objective economic resources and subjective social status influence subjective well-being. Individuals with higher family incomes are happier than those with lower family incomes. In addition, perceiving oneself in a higher social class increases one’s happiness level. This study also finds other factors to be significantly related to general happiness, including educational degree, working status, occupational prestige, religious belief, age, and health condition. These factors represent a comprehensive view of individual’s socioeconomic status in impacting happiness.
